        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This East African snack is fluffy, hollow on the inside, mildly sweet in flavor, and crisp on the outside. (If that sounds to you like the best parts of French beignets and American old-fashioned doughnuts combined into one, delicious bite, then you’re right). The coconut milk in this recipe, which is adapted from my cookbook <em>Let's Eat</em>, adds a unique mellow sweetness to the dough that doesn’t feel overly indulgent.</p>
        <p>The key to achieving the perfect hollow mandazi is to continue to agitate the dough when frying by flipping them and pressing them down to submerge in the oil. To make this recipe vegan-friendly, substitute vegetable or coconut oil for the melted butter.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp. instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp. ground cardamom</li>
            <li>2 cups all purpose flour, additional for surface</li>
            <li>1/3rd cup of sugar</li>
            <li>1 and a half cup full-fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for bowl and frying; about 8 cups)</li>
            <li>Chai, sweetened condensed milk, or Nutella (for serving)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk yeast, cardamom, 2¼ cups all-purpose flour, and ¼–⅓ cup sugar, depending on your sweetness preference, in a large bowl to combine.</li>
            <li>Whisk coconut milk, butter, and ¼ cup water in a measuring glass. Microwave until lukewarm, about 15 seconds. (Alternatively, heat in a small saucepan until lukewarm.) Pour into dry ingredients and stir with a rubber spatula until incorporated. Dough will appear shaggy and a bit dry.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until soft and dough springs back when gently pressed, 13–15 minutes. (Alternatively, you can knead in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook on medium speed, 8–10 minutes.) Transfer dough to an oiled large bowl, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough back to a lightly floured surface, cut into 4 equal portions, and roll each portion into ⅛"–¼"-thick rounds. Cut each round into 4–6 triangle-shaped portions, depending on the desired size.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a large pot to come 2" up sides, clip thermometer to sides, and heat over medium until thermometer registers 325°. Working in batches of 2 or 3, carefully drop dough pieces into oil. They will sink at first, then float to the surface. Once they come to the surface, cook, pushing down, pouring oil over, and turning (this will ensure they puff up and are hollow in the center), until deep golden brown, 5–7 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer mandazi to paper towels and let drain.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with chai, sweetened condensed milk, or Nutella.</li>
