        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This West African peanut stew recipe uses simple, wholesome ingredients. You won’t need anything fancy; just a few veggies and basic spices, plus optional meat.</p>
        <p>If you plan on making a vegetarian peanut stew, you’ll omit the meat and you’ll use a little less broth. Other than that, the recipe is exactly the same.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup tomato sauce or plain diced canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup natural creamy peanut butter (no stir work best)</li>
            <li>2 tsp smoked paprika (adjust as needed)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp cayenne peper, optional</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sea salt or kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>Remaning Ingredients for Stew</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 to 1 tbsp cooking oil as needed – Use 1 tbsp if you are not browning meat.</li>
            <li>1 lb diced stew meat (chicken, beef, or pork), optional</li>
            <li>2 cups broth (2.5 cups if adding meat)</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced garlic (3 small cloves)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp grated fresh ginger or 1 tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>10 ounces (2 small) sweet potatoes, peeled and diced into cubes</li>
            <li>2/3 cup peeled and sliced carrot, optional</li>
            <li>2 cups spinach leaves or 3 cups baby spinach</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Add all the sauce ingredients to a blender or food processor and pulse to combine. Alternatively, you can place them in a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Notes before you begin:</em></strong> If you are using meat, brown it in the pan first, before adding the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat a large, heavy bottomed pot over medium-high heat. When pan is hot, add the meat and brown for 5 minutes, turn meat once to evenly cook. When meat is almost cooked through, remove from pan and place on a large plate or bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add 1/2 tbsp to 1 tbsp oil and onions. Sauté the onions for 3-4 minutes, stirring often and scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Add the ginger and garlic and sauté another 1-2 minutes, then add the sweet potatoes and stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato sauce, peanut butter, spices, spinach, and broth. Stir to combine. Simmer and cover for 1 hour or until sweet potatoes are tender and meat is cooked through.</li>
            </ol>
