        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Jollof rice is a legendary one-pot dish thatâ€™s ubiquitous in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana, Liberia, Togo, and Sierra Leone. In fact, this is the most popular party food in West Africa and has been gaining momentum elsewhere in East Africa.</p>
        <p>Because of its popularity, there have been several debates as to its origin. What I know for sure is that- it is an amazing one-pot dish and there is no argument when everyone is shoving it down their throat.</p>
